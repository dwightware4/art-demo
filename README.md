## Music Machine

This is a basic web app built on Ruby on Rails and React.js. It takes in keyboard input from the bottom row of keys and produces musical notes in the key of C as a result. It can also record songs by listening to keypresses and storing them along with a timestamp in a JS object. It can then play songs back by iterating over the object and emitting the proper frequencies at the proper times to reproduce the song. This app has no CSS, and is not currently hosted live anywhere, however it can be downloaded and run on a local server for testing and experimentation.
